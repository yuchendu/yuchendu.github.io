# Areas of Interest

Dr. Du's research interest primarily focuses on anomaly detection methods for medical images. He aims to develop a general model capable of accurately reconstructing disease-free counterpart images that maintain normal, personalized anatomical structures. Additionally, He has a keen interest in shape analysis and anomaly detection for 3D objects, such as 3D eyeball MRI scans. Dr. Du is also interested in developing and promoting large language models to improve the diagnosis performance for diverse diseases.
