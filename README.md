# Biography
Dr. Yuchen Du is currently a research fellow in Clinic Research Center, Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Center. He completed his Ph.D. in June 2023, which was a joint initiative between Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai General Hospital, and the University of Sydney, under the supervision of Prof.Xun Xu, who serves as the director of National Clinical Research Center for Eye Diseases, Prof. Lisheng Wang, and Prof. Xiuying Wang. Dr. Du has an interdisciplinary research background, including machine learning (e.g., low-rank decomposition, multi-Mixture of Gaussian, levelset), deep learning (e.g., Vision Transformer, GAN, AutoEncoder), and ophthalmology (e.g., myopia, myopic maculopathy, diabetic retinopathy).

# Areas of Interest
Dr. Du's research interest primarily focuses on anomaly detection methods for medical images. He aims to develop a general model capable of accurately reconstructing disease-free counterpart images that maintain normal, personalized anatomical structures. Additionally, He has a keen interest in shape analysis and anomaly detection for 3D objects, such as 3D eyeball MRI scans. Dr. Du is also interested in developing and promoting large language models to improve the diagnosis performance for diverse diseases.
